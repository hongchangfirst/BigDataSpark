spark-submit --deploy-mode client or cluster

1 client means driver program is going to be executed in the master node instead of worker node.
2 cluster means driver program is going to be executed in one of the worker node.

Generally, if the cluster's master and workers are in the same network, then you can use client mode.

When to use cluster mode?
1 If the cluster's master node is in a separate network of worker nodes. Then you have to use cluster mode.
Since driver needs to transfer Jar package to Executors in worker node.
2 If you want to make sure the driver can be reboot if failure happens, then you need to use cluster mode with
--supervise flag.
