spark-submit --deploy-mode client or cluster

1 client means driver program is going to be executed in the master node instead of worker node.
2 cluster means driver program is going to be executed in one of the worker node.

Generally, if the cluster's master and workers are in the same network, then you can use client mode.

When to use cluster mode?
1 If the cluster's master node is in a separate network of worker nodes. Then you have to use cluster mode.
Since driver needs to transfer Jar package to Executors in worker node.
2 If you want to make sure the driver can be reboot if failure happens, then you need to use cluster mode with
--supervise flag.




###For YARN cluster, --master yarn
You need to have environment variable HADOOP_CONF_DIR or YARN_CONFI_DIR to point the directory which contains
the client side configuration files for the Hadoop cluster.
./bin/spark-submit --class path.to.your.Class --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster [options] <app jar> [app options]

1 client mode means the driver runs in the client process, and the application master is only used for requesting
resources from YARN.
2 cluster mode means the driver runs inside an application master process which is managed by YARN on the cluster,
and the client can go away after initiating the application.

Which understanding is right?
