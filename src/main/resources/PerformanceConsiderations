1 Level of Parallelism
First, if there is too little parallelism, spark might leave resources idle. While if there is too much parallelism,
small overheads associated with each partition can add up and become significant.

2 Serialization Format
If large data needs to be transferred across network(shuffle operations), the performance of
serialization/deserialization play a key part of the performance.

3 Memory Management
  3.a RDD Storage, for cache and persist. (60%)
  3.b Shuffle and aggregation buffers. (20%)
  3.c User code.  (20%)

4 Garbage collection
The cost of GC scales with the number of objects on the heap, not the number of bytes of data. So
taking many objects and serializing them into a single giant buffer can reduce GC time.

5 Hardware Provisioning
Memory and CPU cores.
